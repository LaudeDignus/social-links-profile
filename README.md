## ðŸ§© Best Practices Applied

| Practice | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `rel="noopener noreferrer"` | Prevents reverse tabnabbing and enhances security |
| Descriptive `alt` text | Improves accessibility for screen readers |
| `display: block` on `<a>` | Makes the entire `<li>` clickable without JavaScript |
| `transition` usage | Enhances hover animations |
| CSS Design Tokens | Centralized variables using `:root` for consistency |

## âœ¨ Notable Code Snippet

```css
ul li:hover a {
  color: red;
}
ul li a {
  display: block;
  width: 100%;
  text-decoration: none;
  color: var(--White);
  transition: color 0.3s ease;
}
```

> This allows the link inside a list item to change color when the user hovers over the entire li, improving usability and feedback.

---

## ðŸ“š Key Takeaways

- hover doesnâ€™t cascade to children unless explicitly targeted (li:hover a)

- display: block on `<a>` expands the clickable area

- Even small projects benefit from mobile responsiveness

- Accessibility (contrast, focus, readable structure) is non-negotiable
